We aim to\ndevelop advanced AI models for creating cardiac digital twins, i.e.,\npersonalized virtual heart models. We will employ the dataset (imaging, ECG,\nelectronic medical records, etc) collected from patients, to accurately\nmodelling the anatomy and simulate the function of patients' diseased hearts.\nThese models, coupled with machine learning techniques, contribute to the\nidentification of crucial mechanistic relationships and features that offer\ninsights into the trajectory of a patient's heart condition. The research will\ndelve into the intersection of AI and cardiac sciences, exploring novel\napproaches to revolutionize our understanding of the human heart. With the\npotential to impact medical treatments and technology advancements, it promises\nan exciting and important avenue for personalized medicine.
